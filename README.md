## 🧑‍💻 About Me

Senior Computer Vision & Machine Learning Engineer focusing on **Document OCR/KIE**, **Face Recognition**, and **Anti-Spoofing Detection**.  
Experienced across the full stack from **Model Design (CNN / Transformer / ViT)** to **MLOps (ONNX Runtime, Docker, CI/CD)**.  
I also self-host and maintain a technical blog and research note platform using React + FastAPI + Nginx, demonstrating solid DevOps and full-stack capabilities.

> 📂 Most of my professional work is maintained under the [**DocsaidLab organization**](https://github.com/DocsaidLab). This profile hosts my personal repositories only.
